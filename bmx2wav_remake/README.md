# Bmx2Wav remake ver.

### abstract
- convert *.bmx(bms, bml, bme, etc ...) to audio files(*.wav / ogg)
- have dependency with ```libiconv```, ```libogg```, ```libvorbis```
- original code by CHILD (specially with ```bmsbel / bmx2wav_wav / bmx2wav_wav_maker``` modules)

### how to use
#### command lines
-
#### easy use
- just drag & drop any ```*.bmx``` files to program and there'll be converted ogg file!

### known problems / TODO / etc
- current ogg quality is 0.5 (-1 ~ 1). maybe CBR 192kbps?
- LongNote may sound bad. going to fix it...
